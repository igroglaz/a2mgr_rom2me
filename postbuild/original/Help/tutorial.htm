          on the left side of the Map Editor window, or press &lt;space>). You 
          will see a new bar appear on the left. Select "High Rock" terrain (press 
          &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;8>). By left-clicking and dragging with your mouse 
          cursor, create mountain landscape in the lower left corner of your map 
          (click in the lower-left corner of the minimap window to position edit 
          window there). Now you can try to create a lake in the upper-right corner

          common tiles for special ones by clicking on them. Click several times 
          on any of the "Water" tiles. Pay attention to the changes - you can 
          create a swamp from your lake by changing its tiles. Now go back to 
          the mountain area. Select the "<a href="leftpanel.htm#landscape">Altitude</a>" 
          tool from the "Instruments" bar (or press &lt;shift-a>). Click on a 
          tile and don't release your mouse button. Drag the tile with your mouse 
          cursor up and to the right. You will see a "hill" raising. Vertical 
          dragging controls height of the “hill”, and horizontal - its size. If 
          you are not satisfied with the hill you have created, use &lt;ctrl-z>

          will not be regarded as a multiplayer map). "Min. level" shows map difficulty, 
          and will be calculated automatically. Press "OK". Now your map is playable 
          - however it doesn't contain anything to play with. </font>

          you can create 3 players - "Monsters" (enemy), "Towns" (for town guards) 
          and "Allies" (for shops and taverns). Right now only "Self" player exists 
          - this player is used to set the default diplomacy templates for all 
          new human gamers entering the map. Click "Add Player" button. New player 
          has been added. You can modify his name right now by selecting him on 
          the players list and typing a new name in the upper field. In the same 
          way you can create the other 2 players and rename them to "Towns" and 
          "Allies". Warning: Do not change "Self" player's name, otherwise the 
          map will not work at all! So, you now have 4 players. The next step 
          will be to set their diplomacy. </font>

          dialog box. Please note - the displayed diplomacy chart is for the "Self" 
          player only, and it shows this player's relations with the others. Now 
          you can make "Towns" neutral to "Self" (town guard will return strike 
          if attacked), and make "Allies" player enter alliance with you ("Monsters" 
          are already enemies to "Self"). Warning: Each player should always set 
          "alliance" and "vision" boxes checked for himself. Now press "OK", then 
          select "Monsters" and go to "Diplomacy relations" dialog again. Make 
          "Monsters" enemy to "Towns" and "Allies". Make sure that they are enemies 
          to "Self" and ally to themselves. Press "OK" button. Continue in this 
          way to make "Towns" neutral to self, ally to "Allies" and enemy to "Monsters". 
          Make "Allies" ally to "Self" and "Towns" and enemy to "Monsters". After 
          you have finished, press "OK" in the "Modify player" dialog. Warning:

          tool (&lt;shift-s>). The structure list will be displayed on the right 
          side of the map-editing window. A shop and a tavern are the two basic 
          town structures. Select "Plagat Inn 1" from the list displayed to the 
          right. Change its owner to "Allies" in the "Player" drop-down list above 
          the structure list.&nbsp; Place it in the upper left part of the map. 
          Now select "Multiplayer Plagat Shop 1" and place it nearby (it also 
          will belong to "Towns" player). You can place several other building 
          around these two to make you town look better. </font>

          for players joining your map. We recommend that you make a staring point 
          in town, near a shop and a tavern. Choose a tile between the shop and 
          the tavern and click on it. "Trigger manager" dialog will appear. Click 
          "Manage instants" button on it. Select "Drop Location" instance from 
          the left list. On the right you can see "Parameters", showing coordinates 
          of the tile you have clicked on. Now press "Add new" to add this drop

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now you can 
          create guard of your town. Select "<a href="leftpanel.htm#units">Units</a>" 
          tool (press &lt;shift-u>). You can see the unit bar appear on the right. 
          At the top of the bar you can select either "Human" or "Monster" units. 
          Choose "Human". The list of units will be changed. Now select player 
          "Towns" (town guard) and choose some units - for example, "2F_Knight1". 
          It can be defined as "ROM2 Game, Fighter class, Knight race, Level 1". 
          Other possibilities are: classes - Archer, Mage, Horseman, races - Brigand, 
          Peasant, Hunter, level - 1, 2, 3, 4. Some units might have a "leader" 
          who is the most powerful fighter of their level. After selecting "2F_Knight1", 
          note his "group number". Units belonging to one and the same group will 
          act together and assist each other. All units of one group should belong 
          to one and the same player. Now look at the upper-left part of the units 
          bar - it contains "Group" area (with "Repop" button and "Current" number). 
          Change "Current" number to "1". Now you can locate "group 1" units. 
          Place 3 knights around your town by clicking on tiles. You can remove 
          an incorrectly placed unit by shift-clicking on it. Otherwise, you can 
          "drag" it with your mouse cursor to a better position. You can now see 
          3 units on the map with 2 number shown for each of them. The left number 
          is its unique ID, and the right one is its group number. Now select 
          "2A_Knight1" and place two archers behind the knight. After that, select 
          "2M_Knight1" and place a mage. You have created group 1 of player "Towns" 
          containing 6 units of different types. </font>

          the upper left part of the bar. Select "Monsters" player instead of 
          "Towns". Change "group current" to 2. Now you can position the group 
          2, player "Monsters" units. The interface is pretty similar to the one 
          we have described in the previous step. Monsters have "type" and "level" 
          in their name, so "Goblin_Pike.3" means "Goblin with pike" type and 
          level 3. You will see that some monsters have variants of different 
          levels, and some do not. Please do not use the last ones - they are 
          have not been designed for multiplayer maps. Right now, select "Goblin_Pike" 
          unit. Place some of them in the lower-right part of map. Raise the "group 
          current" number. Place another group of goblins nearby. Raise the "group 
          current" and place two goblins, then choose "Ogre" unit and place him 
          behind them. So now we have enemies to fight - 2 goblin groups and one 
          group of ogre with two goblins assisting. </font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Select "<a href="leftpanel.htm#objects">Objects</a>" 
          tool (&lt;shift-o>). Now you can place trees, rocks, fences and other 
          objects by selecting them from the right bar list and clicking on the 
          chosen tile. You can delete incorrect objects by shift-clicking on them. 
          Mouse dragging will not work with objects. Please do not place objects 
          over units - it will not work. You can randomize landscape by pressing 
          &lt;ctrl-e> if you are not satisfied with the results you have achieved. 
          Here is an easy way to create a nice forest: just copy them from another 
          map and paste it on yours. While doing so, please note the standard 
          buttons in the Map Editor toolbar (below the menu). Open the map you 
          wish to copy from,&nbsp; press "select area" bar, then click on the 
          upper left and lower right corners of the area you wish to copy. Press 
          "Copy" button. Now switch back to your map, and press "Paste" button. 
          Select a tile (it will be considered as the upper-left corner of the 
          copied area). If you wish not to copy some info, you can use "Edit" 
          menu to choose what should be copied. You can delete wrong units, objects 
          and buildings with &lt;shift-click>, drag units and building on to new 
          positions, and copy/paste forests and mountains from other maps. </font>

          </font>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Choose "<a href="leftpanel.htm#build">Structures</a>" 
          tool and right-click on the shop you have placed on the map. As soon 
          as it is selected in the structure list, you can modify it. Click on 
          "special" button above the structure list. A "Shop Setup" dialog will 
          appear. You can choose the items to be generated on each of the shop's 
          shelves. From top to bottom, entry fields mean: "Min." - minimum price 
          of a generated item, "Max." - maximum price, "Max" - maximum number 
          of different items generated, "Single-Type" - number of "stock" items 
          of similar type to be generated (there can be 100 potions, for example). 
          "Shapes and materials" option allows you to keep some of items from 
          generating. Click on the "Shapes and materials" button to get to "Shop 
          Materials/Shapes/Types" dialog. Now you can check the items to be or 
          not to be generated. 'Materials' are the types of materials from which 
          items are made. 'Types' are the types of items generated (it would be 
          better if these types are chosen in accordance with the shop shelf graphics 
          in the game). 'Shapes' are the different forms of one and the same item 
          made of similar materials. For example, shaman staves made from magic 
          wood can have different shapes. "Allowed extra" defines whether the 
          generated items will have magic implemented in them or not, or both. 
          Note that all changes in this dialog will affect only one shelf, not 
          the entire shop. Be careful not to create shelves where nothing can 
          be generated at all. For example, there are no "Crystal" material items&nbsp; 
          of "Common" shapes or with the price lower then 100000. You can get 
          a list of all items available in the game by selecting "Place Items" 
          tool (&lt;shift-i>) and clicking on any unoccupied tile while the map 
          is in editing condition (you should leave all dialogs to achieve this 
          condition). After you have finished designing shelves, leave the "Shop 
          Setup" dialog. </font>

          If your wish your town to serve the good rather than evil powers, you 
          should not create "Raise dead" quests. If you want to make "Delivery
